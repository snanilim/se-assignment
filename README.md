# Note
Please consider it as a simple assignment. i didn't add much validation or real life user flow. 

# Backend
For backend i used node express and mongoDB. Actually i build this API boilerplate as node API starter. This database already connected with Mongodb Atlas. So you don't need to do anything if you use cloud DB.
```
cd backend-api
```
```
If you want to run this project in local db please rename. and use mongodb dump
.env_local to .env
```
for run backend
```
yarn install
```
```
yarn start
```

# Frontend
For Frontend i used Next js.
```
cd view-app
```
```
yarn install
```
```
yarn dev
```
# Others
You wil find others file like ED, DFD, DB dump in others folder.
